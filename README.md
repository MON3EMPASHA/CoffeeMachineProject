# Coffee Machine Project

The Coffee Machine Project is a Python-based simulation of a simple coffee vending machine. It provides users with a menu of various coffee options such as espresso, latte, and cappuccino, allowing them to make selections based on their preferences. The program checks the availability of required ingredients, processes payments, and dispenses the selected beverage.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:** Execute the `main.py` script to start the coffee machine simulation.

2. **Order Drinks:** Follow the prompts to select your preferred drink from the menu options. You can choose from "espresso," "latte," or "cappuccino."

3. **Payment:** Insert coins when prompted to pay for your selected drink.

4. **Enjoy:** Once payment is successful, the coffee machine prepares and dispenses your beverage. Enjoy your freshly brewed coffee!

### Keywords:
